### Stage 8: Collaborative Token Pairing and Exchange Across Multiple DEXes

**Objective**: To deepen our hands-on experience and collaboration, we'll each pair our SPL token with those created by fellow students, forming a network of liquidity pools across various Solana DEXes. This initiative aims not only to apply our DeFi development skills but also to engage with the broader ecosystem by utilizing different decentralized exchanges. By swapping tokens within these diverse pools, we symbolize a collective success in our development journey, ensuring a broad understanding of the Solana DeFi landscape.

#### Requirements:
- **Token Deployment**: Each participant must have created their SPL token and shared the deployer address in our group repository, ensuring all tokens are accessible for pooling.
  
- **Token Distribution**: Participants are required to distribute a set amount of their token to the deployer addresses of other students' tokens, facilitating the initial setup for the liquidity pools.

- **Creating LP Tokens on Various DEXes**: To avoid the issue of duplicated pools on a single DEX, each participant will create a liquidity pool pairing their token with a peer's token on different DEXes. This approach allows us to explore and understand the nuances of multiple platforms within Solana's DeFi ecosystem.

- **Swapping in the Liquidity Pool**: The conclusive step involves performing token swaps within each liquidity pool to acquire a set of tokens from every participating student's project, marking the achievement of our collaborative goal.

#### Execution Plan:
1. **Coordinate DEX Selection**: We'll collaboratively decide which DEXes to use, ensuring that each pair is created on a different platform to maximize our learning and avoid pool duplication.
   
2. **Distribute and Publish Tokens**: Following a deadline, all participants will distribute their tokens based on the shared deployer addresses and document the DEX chosen for their liquidity pool.

3. **Liquidity Pool Creation**: With tokens distributed, we proceed to set up the liquidity pools on our selected DEXes. Participants will share the process, outcomes, and any platform-specific insights gained.

4. **Conduct Swaps and Reflect**: After swapping tokens across these various pools, we'll gather to discuss the technical and strategic aspects of our experience, focusing on the differences and challenges encountered across multiple DEXes.

#### Expected Outcome:
By engaging with different decentralized exchanges, we not only achieve a comprehensive practical understanding of liquidity pool mechanics but also gain insights into the operational diversity within the Solana DeFi ecosystem. This stage highlights our collective proficiency in DeFi principles and celebrates our collaborative effort to integrate our projects within the broader blockchain community.

This venture underscores the importance of teamwork, knowledge sharing, and adaptability in the dynamic field of blockchain technology. Together, we navigate the complexities of multiple DEX platforms, showcasing our collective capability to innovate and succeed in the DeFi space.
