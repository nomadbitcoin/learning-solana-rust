# Solana Development Learning Path

This document outlines my journey to mastering Solana development particularly focusing on decentralized finance (DeFi). My background in blockchain and EVMs has paved the way for this dive deeper into what makes Solana unique.

## Active Participation Requirement: Code, Test, and Collaborate

To ensure our online meetings are as productive and engaging as possible, it's crucial that all attending students actively participate in coding exercises throughout our journey. This is not a path meant for passive observation; rather, we are cultivating a community of developers who learn by doing, share their experiences, and collaboratively overcome technical challenges.

### Code Your Way Through DeFi

Each student is expected to actively code, exploring new DeFi concepts and applying them practically. This direct involvement is key to understanding the nuances of Solana's DeFi ecosystem and to developing your skills.

### Testing Each Other's Code

A significant part of our collaborative effort will involve peer testing—reviewing and testing each other's code. This practice will enhance our learning experience, allowing us to identify and solve issues collaboratively, thereby improving our collective output.

### Share Your Journey
Encouragement is given to all participants to actively contribute to discussions by sharing their development experiences, challenges, and solutions related to the topic. This exchange is crucial for collective advancement. To maintain focus on our DeFi objectives, I will guide our learning path and discussions, ensuring relevance and depth in our exploration. This directed approach will enable us to efficiently navigate the complexities of decentralized finance, fostering a productive learning environment for all.

## Rust Refresher for SPL Token Creation

Before diving into the intricacies of Solana-specific development, we'll revisit certain Rust fundamentals that are pivotal for effectively working with the Solana Program Library (SPL) and its token standards.

### Ownership, Borrowing, and Lifetimes

While a deep understanding of Rust's memory management comes with time and practice, it's foundational for effective Solana programming. We'll begin with the core principles of ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes, applying these concepts practically to our blockchain development tasks. 

### Error Handling

Given that transactions can fail for numerous reasons, robust error handling is non-negotiable. We will delve into Rust’s `Result` and `Option` types to gracefully manage both expected and unexpected errors.

### Serialization/Deserialization
